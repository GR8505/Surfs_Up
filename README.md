# Surfs Up Analysis

---------------
## Overview ##
---------------
In this project, I collected seasonal weather data for an entrepreneur who was seeking to
start a surf board and milkshake business in Oahu.  However, while this type of business
may be profitable for the majority of the year, the investor was a bit concerned about the
weather patterns, especially for the months of June and December, when it tends to fluctuate.

My main task was to create an [app](https://github.com/GR8505/Surfs_Up/blob/master/app.py) to collect key statistical data for the months of June and 
December. Once that was completed, I then proceeded to compare my findings and made a couple 
of recommendations for further analysis.

See [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/GR8505/Surfs_Up/blob/master/climate_analysis.ipynb) for full syntax on how this was achieved.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis ##
-------------------------------------------
1) Performing trend analysis for temperatures to see if there are cyclical patterns
2) Performing statistical analysis for precipitation
